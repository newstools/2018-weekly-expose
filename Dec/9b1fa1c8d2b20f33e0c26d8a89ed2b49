CAPE TOWN,  December 27  – President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared a special provincial funeral for former Gauteng member of the executive council (MEC) Khabisi Mosonkutu, the presidency said on Thursday.

He died on Monday at the age of 69. “We have lost a stalwart of our liberation and of democratic governance and development in the economic heart of our country.
