YAOUNDE, Cameroon, December 4 – The Cameroonian government has condemned the Confederation of African Football (Caf) after losing its 2019 African Cup of Nations hosting rights. A government minister said on Tuesday the decision was “unfair” and a “blatant injustice”. The bad news for Cameroon surfaced last Monday when Caf announced it had taken away their hosting rights “because of delays in preparation for the tournament, due to start in June”. Cameroon’s Minister of Communication, Issa Tchiroma Bakary said the government was “dismayed”. “In the face of this blatant injustice, the government of the Republic urges the people of Cameroon to remain calm and not to indulge in futile arguments,” said Bakary. “Cameroon has put up a creditable performance. We shall prove to the entire world by completing on time the construction of all the modern infrastructure which belongs to the Cameroonian people.” (ANA)
