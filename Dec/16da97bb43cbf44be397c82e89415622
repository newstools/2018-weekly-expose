JOHANNESBURG, December 7 – South Africa’s marketing agency on Friday called for humanitarian support after a fire gutted shacks at an informal settlement in Johannesburg’s Alexandra township. “Brand South Africa calls on all to unite, play their part and assist with providing humanitarian support in the form of food, water, shelter which can be delivered to Alex and the Sandton fire station,” the agency said. “It is imperative now more than ever to be reminded that ‘a nation’s greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members'” Brand SA applauded aid organisations such as Gift of the Givers which were on site in Alexandra to provide relief.
