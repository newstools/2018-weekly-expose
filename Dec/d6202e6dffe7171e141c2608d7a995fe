DURBAN, December 27 – Clinton Larsen’s three year-spell as head coach of Lamontville Golden Arrows has come to an end, the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) club confirmed on Thursday. Larsen’s exit comes just three days after another KZN team, Maritzburg United parted ways with their head coach, Fadlu Davids. Kaizer Chiefs‚ Black Leopards‚ Free State Stars and Chippa United have also all appointed new head coaches in the past five weeks. Larsen leaves Abafana bes’Thende with the club in 11th position on the league table, four points above the drop zone. Since beating Maritzburg 2-0 on the opening day of this season, Arrows have subsequently managed just two wins in 14 league matches, their last victory a 2-1 win over Kaizer Chiefs on December 1. “Lamontville Golden Arrows would like to announce that we have parted ways with head coach Clinton Larsen‚ by mutual agreement between both parties‚” the club said in a statement. “After careful consideration‚ both the club and Clinton agree that this is in the best interest of both parties for the relationship to end with immediate effect. Clinton has been totally professional in his approach to his work and in parting ways‚ we wish him all the best for his future.” At the end of Larsen’s first season with the Durban-based club, Arrows finished ninth, followed by two consecutive eighth-placed finishes over the last two campaigns. He previously worked at Maritzburg United in 2013, and could now come into consideration for that job following Davids’ departure earlier this week. Eric Tinkler and Dan Malesela are other local men who could potentially be in the reckoning for the head coach role at both Arrows and Maritzburg. Abafana bes’Thende’s next game is indeed against Maritzburg – at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on January 6. (ANA)
