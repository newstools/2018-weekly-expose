JOHANNESBURG, December 18- Kaizer Chiefs are preparing for the second-leg of their first round of the CAF Confederation Cup clash as they travel to Madagascar to tackle Association Sportive Saint-Michel Elgeco Plus at Stade d’Analamanga on Saturday. Chiefs take a healthy lead to the island nation off the south-east coast of Africa. Philani Zulu and Leonardo Castro’s brace of goals sealed a 3-0 aggregate victory ahead of the return game. Amakhosi will travel on Friday, optimistic to advance to the play-off stage which, should they win, will get them to the group stages of the competition.  (ANA)
