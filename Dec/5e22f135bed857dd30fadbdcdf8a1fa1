Solly Makganoto Former Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns player Lerato Chabangu says that he still has two or three years to play professionally once more. This comes after a picture of him with a beer bottle in his hand was circulated on social media, and it was said that he was struggling financially.  @Soccer_Laduma where is lerato chabangu  pic.twitter.com/ms7tF1sKma — MAKATUMANYUHA (@Skataboy2) November 28, 2018  Chabangu was interviewed by sports broadcaster Robert Marawa on his Marawa Sports Worldwide show on Radio 2000 on Wednesday night, and the ex-striker spoke about the difficulties he has had to endure in recent years. Chabangu first made his name at Mamelodi Sundowns from 2005 until 2009, and later on went to Moroka Swallows from 2011-2015. “You can say I have been hiding from people, I don’t even go to stadiums,” Chabangu told Marawa. “I do feel like I’m depressed. I comfort myself by watching TV. I disappointed lots of people. “I was found in a wrong space, most of my friends were living in township. I could say that I have destroyed myself, I can’t really blame others. If you are at the wrong space, the negative things will catch you.” But now Chabangu wants to start a foundation, and even get back on to the football pitch that once made him a star and earned him 28 caps for Bafana Bafana. “This problem that I am having (depression), I know I am not alone,” he said. “I was hoping to open the Lerato Chabangu Foundation to help (people) where I come from. “I will be open to help the younger ones that are coming (through). They should not go through what I went through. “Be careful what you do in life, be strong and keep praying, it will help. Thanks for the loved ones who have been following and supporting me, I really appreciate that. “I have never retired. I can play at least one or two years if I get a chance.” Click here to listen to the full interview:
