PRETORIA, December 13  – The North Gauteng High Court has ordered the State Attorney to take all necessary steps, including the institution of civil proceedings to recover the money spent on paying for former president Jacob Zuma’s legal fees. “The State attorney is directed within three months of the date of this order, to file a report, under oath and supported by the full and complete accounting…detailing the steps that have been taken and that will be taken to recover the amounts paid by the State for Mr Zuma’s legal costs,” said Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba in the judgement. An agreement between Zuma and the Presidency to pay for his legal fees was also set aside. Ledwaba said the State should not be held liable for Zuma’s fees, both in criminal and civil matters. The application to have Zuma pay back the money was brought by the Democratic Alliance (DA) which was later joined by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). During arguments, Advocate Thembelihle Ngcukaitobi for the EFF said Zuma’s legal fees to date are closer to R32.2 million. It is not clear how the party came to that amount as it is believed that the fees amount to around R15.3 million. The party also wanted Zuma’s former lawyer Michael Hulley to also pay back money paid to him by the State. Hulley was Zuma’s long-time lawyer. DA leader Mmusi Maimane, who was in court on Thursday, said the judgement is something that should be celebrated. “It sets that the deal between Zuma and (President Cyril) Ramaphosa is irrational and illegal and it sets that aside. It stops the cycle of corruption to continue and now people who want to steal people’s money must think twice.” The court had been asked to decide whether or not Zuma should pay back the R15.3 million the state has already spent on his legal fees to defend allegations of impropriety levelled against him over the years. The fees were incurred as far back as 2006, during Zuma’s criminal prosecution in the so-called spy tapes matter. (ANA)
