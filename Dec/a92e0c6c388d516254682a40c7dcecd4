LONDON, England, December 11 – Liverpool’s in-form forward Egyptian Mohamed Salah was again in rampant form when he scored a hattrick against Bournemouth in the club’s 4-0 victory in the English Premier League over the weekend. Salah was once again the outstanding African performer in the major European leagues with his treble, helping Liverpool triumph and replace Manchester City at the top of the table, especially after City were beaten by Chelsea later in the day. Salah is joint leading-scorer in the Premier League on 10 goals with another African, Gabon sharpshooter Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal. Meanwhile South African striker Lebo Mothiba was another to enjoy a good day. The 22-year-old, who has six Bafana caps, scored his eighth Ligue 1 goal of the season to give eighth-placed French team Strasbourg the lead for the second time in a 2-2 home draw with lowly Caen. In October, during a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match against Seychelles, Mothiba became the first player to score in three consecutive matches for South Africa from debut. But it was a bad weekend for another African footballer. Fulham’s Cameroonian Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa showed some fight in the second half against Manchester United, but received a second yellow card followed by a red just a minute after Fulham had pulled a goal back to make it 3-1. Another African-born player in action was the Ivory Coast’s Wilfried Zaha, probably Crystal Palace’s best player over the last year. Zaha’s creative talent and goals were integral to Palace escaping the drop last season but he has not scored since mid-September. The club – with just one win in 11 Premier League games after Saturday’s loss at West Ham – are only two points above the relegation zone. They need the 26-year-old Ivory Coast international to fire, and soon. (ANA)
