CAIRO, Egypt, December 6  – The Egyptian Football Federation (EFA) says it “does want to compete with another Arabic country” and has ruled itself out of the bidding process to host the 2019 African Cup of Nations. The venue for Afcon 2019 is still up in the air after the Confederation of African Football (CAF) voted unanimously to strip Cameroon of hosting rights. “After an EFA meeting on Tuesday, we decided we will not make a bid for the next Afcon,” EFA board member Ahmed Megahed said. “We will not compete with another Arabic country – this is an official decision,” Megahed told local media outside the EFA headquarters in Cairo. Morocco, who stepped in to hold this year’s African Nations Championship (CHAN) after Kenya were deemed not ready, and South Africa are under consideration as replacement hosts. Egypt last hosted an Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 when the Pharaohs won the trophy. CAF said it would “initiate an open and urgent call for new host country bids to ensure Afcon 2019 takes place next summer” and would “ensure that a new host is in place by 31st December 2018.” (ANA)
