JOHANNESBURG, December 10 – Charl Schwartzel said it was a “nice bonus” after he, Romain Langasque and Oliver Wilson on Sunday qualified for the British Open next year after solid performances in the SA Open at Randpark. The Open, which is the official name of the world’s oldest national championship, will be played at Royal Portrush in Ireland in July. For 2011 US Masters winner Schwartzel, it will be a 15th Open appearance and 11th in a row as he goes in search of a second Major Championship. “It’s a nice bonus,” he said. “I was hoping to do better in this tournament but I’m still happy that I get to play The Open in Northern Ireland which will be really nice. “Watching Ernie’s last win and when Tiger won at Hoylake are two of my best memories of The Open and obviously when my good friend Louis won at St Andrews. “It’s special. There’s so much history behind it and it would be nice to have my name on the trophy one day.” Three places were available at the South African Open for the top three players in the top-10 not already exempt, and Langasque fired a closing 66 to finish in solo second behind 2010 Claret Jug winner Louis Oosthuizen. Schwartzel and Wilson finished two shots further back in a tie for third alongside Thomas Aiken and Bryce Easton, claiming the other two places by virtue of their higher positions in the Official World Golf Ranking. – African News Agency (ANA)
