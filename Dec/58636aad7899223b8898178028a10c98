London – Liverpool secured top spot at Christmas after they won 2-0 at Wolves on Friday. Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk scored the goals, in either half to put Liverpool four points clear of Manchester City, who play Crystal Palace on Saturday. Wolves had plenty of possession and caused Liverpool problems but Salah put them in front on 18 minutes. And Van Dijk popped up in the opposition box just over 20 minutes from time with a superb left-foot finish to put Liverpool top going into Christmas.  (dpa)
