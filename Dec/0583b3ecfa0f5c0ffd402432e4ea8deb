CAPE TOWN, December 11 – Pote Human was announced as coach of the Bulls’ Super Rugby team in Pretoria on Tuesday, with Alan Zondagh joining as the Director of Rugby. Rassie Erasmus will mentor the new Bulls technical staff in the 2019 season. Human was in charge of the Bulls during their Currie Cup campaign this year, replacing former coach John Mitchell. Blue Bulls president Willem Strauss says Victor Matfield withdrew from the process of becoming the union’s Super Rugby coach – citing the “insecurities” of the job. (ANA)
