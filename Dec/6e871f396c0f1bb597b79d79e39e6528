PRETORIA, December 12  – Former Springbok hooker Naka Drotske’s condition became critical on Wednesday, according to his cousin Steven Drotkse. “Please pray for Naka Drotske, he is fighting for his life, in critical condition in ICU. I truly believe our Heavenly Father has got some bigger plans for him and his future,” Steven Drotske said in a Facebook post on Wednesday afternoon. Drotske, 47, was shot three times during a home invasion just outside Pretoria on November 29. Drotske played 26 Tests for the Springboks and formed part of the World Cup-winning team in 1995. (ANA)
