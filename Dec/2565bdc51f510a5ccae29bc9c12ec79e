JOHANNESBURG, December 21 – The board of troubled retail company Edcon has approved the structure of a proposed recapitalisation plan and in response lenders have extended waivers to allow time for implementation, CEO Grant Pattison said on Friday. “The restructuring and recapitalisation of Edcon has passed its next hurdle,” Pattsion said in a brief statement. He said the waiver extensions would “allow sufficient time for the number of necessary due diligence and governance processes to be completed”. “At this stage, we can’t release any additional detail as we remain subject to confidentiality agreements. The board fully appreciates the support that is being received from all group stakeholders and the commitment that has been shown,” Pattison said, adding the company would make further announcements in due course. Earlier this week Pattison dismissed a report by the Sunday Times that Edcon had sent out a letter to its 31 biggest landlords, asking for a two-year 41 percent “rent holiday” in exchange for a five percent stake in the business in a bid to stave off liquidation and the loss of up to 40,000 direct and 100,000 indirect jobs. He said the story was “irresponsible and sensationalist reporting” adding that Edcon had been with this risk for some time and was close to a deal to fix the business. Pattison also called on workers not to panic, saying their jobs were safe. Edcon, the largest non-food retailer in South Africa which owns Edgars, Jet and CNA, has been struggling for the last couple of years in the face of an onslaught of cheap foreign imports and a move by consumers to e-commerce.
