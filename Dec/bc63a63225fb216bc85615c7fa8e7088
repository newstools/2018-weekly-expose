JOHANNESBURG, December 27 – Disaster management teams were placed on standby across Pietermaritzburg on Thursday, after a freak storm ripped through large parts of KwaZulu-Natal, member of the executive council for cooperative governance and traditional affairs, Nomusa Dube-Ncube said. “So far our disaster management teams are keeping an eye on the development of this freak thunderstorm, areas that are prone to flooding are being monitored, and motorists are urged to seek shelter and wait for the storm to pass,” said Dube-Ncube. Dube-Ncube urged residents to take caution as heavy storms pose a serious risk. According to reports received by the department from the South African Weather Service, heavy storms will continue until 11pm on Thursday in areas along the coast and interior of the province. Dube-Ncube also urged residents in low lying areas to seek shelter on higher ground as the risk of localised flooding was very high in areas that were being hit by the storm. – African News Agency (ANA)
