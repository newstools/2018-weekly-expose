CAPE TOWN, December 11 – The high court in Cape Town on Tuesday sentenced convicted child killer Mortimer Saunders to two life terms in prison. The sentences will run concurrently. Saunders, who was convicted in November of the rape and murder of three-year-old Courtney Pieters, was also declared unfit to possess a firearm. The self-confessed child killer was arrested in May 2017 after the body of Pieters was found in Epping Industria, nine days after she was reported missing from her Elsies River home. Saunders denied raping the girl before she died but has admitted to necrophilia. He also claimed that she died after he fed her ant poison because she had been disturbing him at the house he shared with her and her family. Handing down sentence, Western Cape High Court Judge Babalwa Mantame said: “This court heard evidence on the murder statistics in the Western Cape, more especially the cluster in which Elsies River falls under and which this case emanates from. “The accused committed the most horrendous crime including the extent of violence used, the cruelty of the attack, the nature and character of the victim normally aggravating the crime. For count one, which is rape, the court sentences you to life imprisonment. For count two (murder), the court sentences you to life imprisonment and this court declares you unfit to possess a firearm.” (ANA)
