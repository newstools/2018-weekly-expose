JOHANNESBURG, October 5 – The South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) has announced that it will next week honour Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). In a statement on Friday, the SAJBD said: “This coming Monday the Jewish community will pay tribute to South African icon Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi”. Charisse Zeifert, the head of communications at SAJBD added: “His ties with Kwa-Zulu Natal Jewry have been particularly rewarding, resulting in joint projects that have seen initiatives in the field of HIV Aids prevention and the implementation of education upliftment programmes in underprivileged areas. “In addition to the warmth shown to the Jewish community, Prince Buthelezi has also been a staunch advocate of finding a peaceful resolution for the Israeli – Palestinian conflict. He has visited Israel many times over the years and has been outspoken in calling for closer ties between Israel and South Africa.” Zeifert concluded: “To celebrate the wonderful milestone of his 90th birthday, the SA Jewish community will host a special evening to pay tribute to Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to take place on Monday 8 August at Glenhazel Shul on the Yeshiva College Campus at 17h45.” Buthelezi, who founded the IFP in 1975, turned 90 on 27 August. (ANA)
