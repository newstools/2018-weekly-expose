JOHANNESBURG, October 31 – The sentencing of convicted sex-offender Collan Rex – a former assistant polo coach at Parktown Boys High School – on Wednesday hit a hurdle when probation officers failed to show up at the High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court. State prosecutor Arveen Persad told the court the officers were not present which meant that the matter could not proceed. Eight probation officers had been assigned to the case, but Persad said they would only be available to testify in court at the end of November. “I’m very upset about this. We arranged this date long ago. Please convey the court’s dissatisfaction,” Judge Peet Johnson said. Rex was found guilty of 12 counts of assault and 144 of sexual assault. The accused turns 23 on Saturday. Judge Johnson said despite being reluctant to postpone sentencing the matter, it would have to resume on the 27 November. After, the postponement a distraught parent of one of the boys abused by Rex revealed that: “My son is at a psychiatric hospital and we hope he would be home soon… I think this man should go to jail and I’m not sure if the judge understands what truly happened.” He said he hoped an adequate sentence was handed down to Rex. Gauteng department of education spokesperson Steve Mabona said, “the department was working hard to make sure that the situation at Parktown Boys changed”. Mabona said MEC Panyaza Lesufi said a way forward was needed and that he could not publicly release a report that was done because it had names of individuals and children. He said both the reports that were conducted on the school stated that the culture of silence needed to be stopped. Mabona said there were many programmes implemented to ensure change at the school. (ANA)
