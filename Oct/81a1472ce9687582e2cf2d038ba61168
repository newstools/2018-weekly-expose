RUSTENBURG, October 17 – Two farm workers accused of killing a teenage boy in Coligny over stolen sunflower heads were found guilty at the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Wednesday. Judge Ronnie Hendricks convicted Pieter Doorewaard, 27, and Phillip Schutte, 34, of murder, kidnapping, intimidation, theft and pointing of a firearm. The State had charged that the pair killed Matlhomola Mosweu, 16, on April 20, 2017, by pushing him out of a moving van after they allegedly caught him stealing from their employer’s field. The two had maintained he jumped from the moving van. The sole eyewitness of the incident, Bonakele Pakisi, however had testified that Mosweu, known as Faki amongst his peers, was pushed from the moving van. The case was postponed to Thursday for sentencing and the two men remain in custody pending sentencing. (ANA)
