Berlin – Belgium are now sole leaders at the top of FIFA’s world rankings after sharing the honour with world champions France last month. The Red Devils are just one point ahead of France in the rankings released on Thursday by football’s world governing body. Both sides enjoyed a win and a draw in October, with Belgium beating Switzerland and drawing with the Netherlands, and France defeating Germany and drawing with Iceland. England are up one place to fifth following a 3-2 Nations League win in Spain and a goalless draw in Croatia, swapping places with Uruguay. There is no other movement in the top 10, with Brazil third ahead of Croatia, and Portugal seventh followed by Switzerland, Spain and Denmark. Outside the leading 10, the Netherlands have moved up two places to 15th and are now one behind 2014 world champions Germany, who have slipped two places. Overall the biggest mover is Gibraltar, who have improved eight places to 190th after they beat Armenia and Liechtenstein the Nations League for their first-ever competitive wins. (dpa)
