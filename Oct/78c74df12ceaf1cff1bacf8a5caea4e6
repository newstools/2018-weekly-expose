JOHANNESBURG, October 13 – Assistant referee Edward Madidilani, who disallowed a Mamelodi Sundowns goal during the Bloemfontein Celtic and Sundowns league match on October 3, has been sanctioned by Safa for failing to fully comprehend and apply the Offside Law 11. Madidilani, who was running the lines during the game, flagged for offside what was a legitimate goal. The match ended in a goalless draw. The Safa Review Committee, after going through the video footage, decided to demote Madidilani to officiate in the SAB League for the next eight weeks in a bid to improve his understanding, interpretation and application of the offside law. Enock Molefe, who is a seasoned technical instructor, has been given the responsibility of assisting Madidilani. The former international referee will submit Madidilani’s progress report on week four and eight of the sanction period. Safa head of referees, Tenda Masikhwa said the sanction was part of the corrective measures the association applies to officials who have made errors. (ANA)
