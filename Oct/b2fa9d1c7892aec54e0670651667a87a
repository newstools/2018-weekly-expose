JOHANNESBURG, October 4 – Uganda’s military has launched a new condom brand, Ulinzi (Swahili for “protection”), for its soldiers in order to ensure they have safe sex, the BBC reported on Thursday. Chief of Staff Brig Leopold Kyanda told troops they needed to be “safe first and thereafter you can defend the country. If the individual soldier does not ensure that he is secure then there is no way he can defend his country,” he added. A video of the ceremony launching the new condom was shown on NTV. (ANA)
