JOHANNESBURG,  October 16  – Mamelodi Sundowns’ and Bafana Bafana’s Sibusiso Vilakazi has been ruled out for up to six months with a ruptured tendon. This means he is unlikely to feature in the remainder of the 2018/19 season that will conclude in May next year. The Sundowns’ forward sustained the injury on national duty with Bafana, forcing him to leave the camp prematurely before the side went on to thump Seychelles 6-0. The Brazilians’ medical team monitored him after his return from the Bafana camp to confirm the news that his has undergone a successful surgery. This is a blow for the Brazilians as they will be competing in four competitions during that period. There’s the Telkom Knockout where they start against Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday at Lucas Moripe Stadium. After that they will resume their battle to retain the Absa Premiership. Later this year they will return to the Caf Champions League and then feature in the Nedbank Cup next year. But coach Pitso Mosimane has plenty of cover in what is the strongest attacking unit in the country. Toni Silva has slowly been finding his feet and returns from the Fifa break on a high after scoring in Guinea-Bissau’s 2-1 win over Zambia in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. Phakami Mahlambi and Lebohang Maboe have also gelled into the team to add to the group that was there last season when Sundowns finished with the most goals in the league. (ANA)
