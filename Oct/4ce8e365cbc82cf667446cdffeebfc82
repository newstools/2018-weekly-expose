San Francisco – Kanye West has seemingly deleted his social media accounts, following a period in which he courted increasing controversy via the platforms. The rapper’s Instagram and Twitter pages had vanished late Saturday. West attracted criticism recently after using social media to call for an abolishment of the US Constitution’s 13th Amendment – which ended slavery in 1865 – and to voice support for President Donald Trump. The Chicago-native was taken to task for his comments and stance by fellow celebrities. “Trump becoming our president was a loss for the country but your support of him is a loss for the culture,” singer Lana Del Rey commented under a photo of West sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat on his Instagram page. “There’s nothing more maddening than debating someone who doesn’t know history, doesn’t read books, and frames their myopia as virtue,” actor Chris Evans, of “Captain America” fame, replied to one of West’s tweets. West has left social media before. He deactivated his Twitter account for almost a year, only returning in April amid an intense period of recording at a Wyoming studio. He also deleted his Instagram account in May 2017, reactivated it for about a week in February before turning it off after Valentine’s Day. He had only recently returned to it.  (dpa)
