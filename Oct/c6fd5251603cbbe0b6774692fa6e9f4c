JOHANNESBURG, October 4 – De Allende has shrugged off his shoulder injury and has been named at inside-centre in the starting XV to play the All Blacks at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Saturday. Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus said on Thursday he was happy with De Allende’s fitness ahead of Saturday’s Test. “Damian has trained very well and took full contact this week, so he is ready,” said Erasmus. Francos Louw is back in the frame and will start at No 8. He replaces Sikhumbuzo Notshe who will play off the bench. “Notshe played well against the Wallabies last weekend and will offer us something different when he goes on, but Flo (Louw) has a lot of experience and is good on the ground.” Erasmus said he is looking forward to seeing prop Vincent Koch get another run in the Springbok jersey. “Vincent has learnt a lot from playing in Northern Hemisphere conditions and I am sure he is very keen to pull on that Green and Gold jersey again. He has a burning desire to play for the Springboks and I am delighted for him as we continue to build our squad depth.” Erasmus congratulated fullback le Roux for reaching the special milestone of 50 Test caps: “Willie has grown immensely since making his debut five years ago and his calm influence at the back, as well as his experience, will be vital on Saturday. He deserves this accolade.” SA Rugby’s Director of Rugby added that while his team has some momentum going into the big game, they will be looking to improve in all areas against a quality All Blacks team. “They will test us in every department,” said Erasmus. “The All Blacks usually hit hard back after a loss so we have to be mentally and physically ready for a massive contest. We will have to front up in defence and be clinical when we creating chances because the All Blacks punish you for errors and missed opportunities. “The Springboks versus All Blacks at a packed Loftus, I think it’s going to be a special occasion.” (ANA)
