CAPE TOWN, October 30 – Cape Town police have denied rumours that a suspect was arrested in Atlantis in connection with the assassination of lawyer Pete Mihalik, 50, on Tuesday morning. The defence lawyer, well known for representing criminal underworld figures, was shot in the head while dropping off his children at their private school Reddam House in Green Point. His Mercedes had a single bullet hole through the passenger window, although neighbours at the scene reported hearing two gunshots. Mihalik’s son was wounded in the incident and rushed to hospital. He also had a 16-year-old daughter. Mihalik’s wife, who suffered from depression, committed suicide three years ago. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana denied rumours that a suspect had already been arrested, and said a statement would be released in the event of an arrest. Crime scene investigators and forensic experts were still combing the scene for clues, and Cavalcade Road remained cordoned off late morning. Rwexana said the suspect was seen “fleeing the scene in a metallic grey VW Polo”. A parent, who did not want to be identified, said he drove down Calvalcade Road to drop off his daughter, a few minutes after the shooting but thought there had been an accident. The school was placed on lockdown and no parents were allowed past the police cordons. In a letter sent to parents, the school acknowledged the incident and said children could be picked up from another entrance, but that the children were being kept busy. Trauma counsellors will also be brought in and security had been beefed up. Some teenage girls, who appeared distraught, could be seen being collected by their parents. (ANA)
