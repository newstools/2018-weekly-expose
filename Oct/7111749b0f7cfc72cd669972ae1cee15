JOHANNESBURG, October 9 – A group belonging to the Gauteng Shutdown Coordinating Committee (GSCC), who claim to represent at least 13 Coloured communities in the province, on Tuesday marched to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) to demand “inclusion”’ in listed businesses. “We call on the JSE to provide us with a full audit of how many classified Coloureds are employed in all listed companies, and also reveal how many communities benefits from their CSI spend and programmes of development,” GSCC spokesperson Anthony William said. Williams said they want to know how many Coloured, or people of mixed race, have shares on the JSE. “We are asking them to be responsive. We are giving them seven days to respond to our demands.” “The Johannesburg Stock Exchange has accepted the notice letter from the Gauteng Shutdown Coordinating Committee,” Mpho Ledwaba, the head of marketing at the JSE said. “As per standard practice, the letter will be reviewed internally and thereafter the best course of action will be determined and actioned if and where appropriate.” The grouping claims to represent communities including amongst others Westbury, Eldorado Park, Kliptown, Noordgesig and Ennerdale. The group has also vowed to embark on a Blood Friday March to seek justice for a woman who was shot dead in apparent gang violence in Westbury recently, a killing which sparked violent community protests.
