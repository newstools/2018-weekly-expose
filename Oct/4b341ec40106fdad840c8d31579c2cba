RUSTENBURG, October 11 – A truck was set alight in Ventersdorp as protests continued, North West police said on Thursday. Spokesperson Captain Sam Tselanyane said the truck was torched along the N14 on Wednesday night. A van was reportedly pelted with stones on Thursday morning, damaging the windscreen. Tselanyane said the 11 people arrested for public violence were expected appear in the Ventersdorp Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Businesses were not opened in town and schools in the area were also closed although the situation was calm on Thursday. Pockets of protesters were regrouping in the Tshing township and the police were monitoring the situation. On Monday, residents took to the streets demanding the delivery of the N14 development project promised to them in 2006. Community leader Sello Dassie said the project would create jobs for the locals. The N14 project would consist of a shopping mall, town houses, agricultural hub and tourism attraction site. On Wednesday, he said the community would not rest until their demands were met. Ventersdorp merged with the Tlokwe municipality to  create the JB Marks municipality.  (ANA)
