JOHANNESBURG, October 23  – The son in law of deposed Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe was released on US$30 bail on Tuesday after he spent a night in police cells. Simba Chikore, who is married to Bona Mugabe, appeared in Harare Magistrate Court facing a charge of kidnapping involving a Zimbabwe Airways employee, Bertha Zakeyo. The complainant claims the former airline boss – whom she claimed pretended to be captain, held her against her will for more than two hours. Zakeyo said after she was fired she refused to vacate her office resulting in Chikore “kidnapping her”. Granting bail, Magistrate Elisha Singano said there was no compelling evidence against the accused, who was arrested Monday night. The accused was accompanied to court by his wife Bona and prominent lawyer Jonathan Samukange. (ANA)
