PORT ELIZABETH, October 8  – The trial involving a Nigerian pastor charged with human trafficking is expected to kick off in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday. The Nigerian pastor is expected to appear alongside his two alleged accomplices. The two women are accused of recruiting girls from all over the country for purposes of sexual exploitation. The trio are facing more than 60 charges which include racketeering and rape. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them. He also faces charges of fraud and for being in the country illegally. All three of the accused are being represented by Port Elizabeth attorney, Peter Daubermann. The pastor was arrested on April 20 last year, by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, known as the Hawks, at the Port Elizabeth Airport. According to the State, some of the alleged victims are as young as 13-years-old. The pastor has been denied bail on two occasions, as he was deemed a flight risk. The women were arrested in November last year and are out on bail of R2 000. (ANA)
