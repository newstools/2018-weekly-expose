JOHANNESBURG, October 3  – Jose Filomeno dos Santos, the son of former Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos, is under arrest and has been charged over an alleged swindle involving $500 million. The charges against him include the formation of a criminal organisation, illegal enrichment, money laundering and corruption, the Global Information Network (GIN) reported. Authorities are also examining whether his overseas transfers of $500-million were lawful, as instructed by former president dos Santos during his time as chair of the country’s sovereign wealth fund. This latest development comes in the wake of new President João Lourenço’s electoral promise last year to crack down on the endemic corruption in Angola – much of it centering around the family of dos Santos, including his billionaire daughter Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s richest woman. Towards the end of 2017 Isabel dos Santos was fired from her former position as head of the state oil company Sonangol and subsequently relieved of four egregious contracts worth over $22 billion. Lourenço’s crackdown has also targeted several provincial governors, ministers and senior officials, as well as positions in state enterprises which were largely filled by close confidants or family members of his predecessor. (ANA)
