PRETORIA, October 4 – The opposition National Freedom Party on Thursday rejected the two-day jobs summit convened by President Cyril Ramaphosa under the auspices of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC). “There is absolutely no need to hold a job summit in South Africa. Instead, the government must implement its policies and reduce deploying cadres who cannot implement government policies. The increased 53.7 percent rate of unemployed youth in the second quarter of 2018, should serve as a stern lesson and push both the private and public sector to talk less and do more practical work,” said NFP spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu. “NFP calls for [an] unemployed youth allowance for graduates seeking employment. This will enable unemployed graduates to have minimum resources which will allow them to apply. It is a fact that young people face a number of disadvantages when it comes to accessing jobs.” He said job-seeking young people should be allowed to use government offices to print their CVs. “We further suggest that the government open all its offices in all departments to allow unemployed graduates to make printouts of CVs and qualifications for free as a temporary relief,” said Sigudu. “We urge people of South Africa not be easily deceived by the so-called job summit happening in Midrand today until tomorrow, it does not seek to address serious difficulties encountered by ordinary citizens and the majority of young people who are jobless.” The NFP said it believes representatives from government, business, labour and community organizations attending the jobs summit “are wiping problems under the carpet”. “The summit will just become another festival of ideas which are not put into action,” said Sigudu. Ramaphosa has convened the summit as South Africa grapples with stubbornly high unemployment, currently at 27.2 percent of the labour force.
