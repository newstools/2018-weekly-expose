JOHANNESBURG, October 12 – The South African Football Association (SAFA) have announced that the upcoming Afcon matches for Bafana Bafana as well as international matches for Banyana Banyana will not be broadcast on any of the SABC platforms. The immediate matches in question are Bafana Bafana vs Seychelles, Seychelles vs Bafana Bafana as well as the Bafana Bafana vs Nigeria. “SAFA can confirm that despite it having opened discussions with the SABC as early as October 2017 to negotiate a new deal on similar terms and conditions as the immediate past agreement, the SABC decided to make a discourteous offer to SAFA for international football matches to be played in South Africa. “SAFA rejected this offer outright and places on record that the offer is so minuscule that it amounts to an effective no offer. “It is interesting to note that even the apartheid run SABC of old made a better offer to the Association for their rights in this country,” the statement read. (ANA)
