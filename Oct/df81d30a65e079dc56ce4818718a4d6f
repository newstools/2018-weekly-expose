JOHANNESBURG, October 16  – The city of Johannesburg said on Tuesday it had decided to suspend senior officials who were responsible for the processing of the fleet tender for its waste management service provider Pikitup, pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct. The city said it took the step after refuse removal services were disrupted two weeks ago as a result of the inadequately managed contract relating to Pikitup’s non-specialised, specialised and red fleet. “Should the investigation confirm the allegations of misconduct, the city will not hesitate to take appropriate action,” member of the mayoral council for group corporate and shared services Ntombi Khumalo said. The city, run by a multi-party coalition led by the Democratic Alliance, said it was doing all it could to ensure that allegations of misconduct were addressed and services not interrupted. (ANA)
