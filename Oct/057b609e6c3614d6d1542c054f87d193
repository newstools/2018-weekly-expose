JOHANNESBURG, October 4 – The tax fraud case against television personality Bonang Matheba was postponed to next month on Thursday at the Johannesburg Specialised Crimes Court for further investigations. State prosecutor Duduzile Robertse requested that the matter be postponed to 14 November for the defence to make representations. Matheba faces charges for allegedly failing to pay personal tax from 2007 – 2017 and company tax from 2014 – 2017. SARS has not released the amount that Matheba owes. Her bench warrant was cancelled because she appeared in court and had a valid reason for failing to appear at her last court date. Matheba was warned to be at her next appearance to avoid arrest.
