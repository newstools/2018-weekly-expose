Berlin – Cristiano Ronaldo’s lawyer has said documents concerning rape allegations made against the footballer have been “altered and/or completely fabricated.” In a statement posted late Wednesday in the United States, lawyer Peter S. Christiansen said: “To absolve any doubt, Mr Ronaldo has always maintained, as he does today, that what occurred in 2009 in Las Vegas was consensual in nature.” Kathryn Mayorga, 34, alleges she was raped by the Portuguese player at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. Her lawyer, Leslie Stovall, is pursuing civil proceedings through a Las Vegas court. While Ronaldo does not deny making a “mutual agreement and release” with Mayorga in 2010, Christiansen said “his motivations for agreeing to that resolution have been twisted to say the least.” “Far from any admission of guilt or any ulterior motive, Mr Ronaldo was advised to privately resolve the allegations against him in order to avoid the inevitable attempts that are now being made to destroy a reputation that has been built upon hard work, athleticism and honour.” Christiansen claimed that “in 2015, dozens of entities [including law firms] across many different industries throughout Europe were hacked and their electronic data was stolen and captured by a cybercriminal. “This hacker attempted to sell this data, and one media outlet has now irresponsibly published the stolen documents, significant portions of which were altered and/or completely fabricated.” Ronaldo dismissed the claim allegation reported in Germany’s Spiegel magazine and his representatives threatened the weekly with legal action. He also denied the allegation on Twitter, saying: “My clear conscious [sic] will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.” Juventus forward Ronaldo, 33, has not been called up to the Portugal squad for Thursday’s Nations League fixture away to Poland and Saturday’s friendly with Scotland in Glasgow.
