JOHANNESBURG, October 18 – A North West province warrant officer is expected on Thursday to appear in the Ventersdorp Magistrate’s Court on a charge of raping a 14-year-old girl in Tshing Location, Ventersdorp. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) on Wednesday arrested the officer, who is based at Potchefstroom Public Order Policing (Pops),  after investigators received a report of the rape. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said it is alleged that on Monday, two police officers in a Nyala (a police armoured vehicle) picked-up four girls in Tshing Location. “The girls were promised food and drinks. In town, two girls were ordered out of the Nyala after which the police officers left with the other two girls. One of the girls was taken to a guest house, where she was raped,” Dlamini said. “The officer was charged by Ipid investigators in the evening after he was arrested earlier in the day.” (ANA)
