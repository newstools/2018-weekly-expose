Berlin – Monaco have sacked title-winning coach Leonardo Jardim with the team struggling near the bottom of the French Ligue 1 and last in its Champions League group. “I want to thank with deepest respect Leonardo for all the work done,” Monaco chief executive Vadim Vasilyev said. “Leonardo has established himself on the bench of AS Monaco as a reference in Europe and leaves behind a very positive balance sheet. “His passage will remain as one of the most beautiful pages in the history of the club.” Jardim has coached Monaco since 2014 and consistently had the club challenging at the top of the French table, winning the championship in 2017. They also reached the semi-finals of the Champions League but this term has been a struggle with a run of four defeats putting the side 18th of 20 teams in Ligue 1. And in the Champions League they are bottom of Group A without a point after losses to Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Monaco, next in action on October 20 at Strasbourg, did not immediately name a successor. (dpa)
