JOHANNESBURG, October 5 – Wood pulp and paper Sappi said on Friday it had moved to strengthen its leadership in the dissolving wood pulp (DWP) market with the launch of the Verve brand. Sappi said demand for DWP continued to grow with rising consumer preference for products made from renewable, sustainably sourced and processed wood fibre. As a significant producer of DWP, Sappi produces close to 1.4 million tonnes  per annum, with a 16 percent share of the market. “Our products and service offering within the dissolving pulp market are highly valued and we remain an industry leader in this space,” CEO Steve Binnie said. “Verve gives recognition to this enviable reputation and the value we offer this market. Sappi Verve represents our commitment to the entire value chain from brand owners through to the cellulosic fibre producers; our commitment to producing a natural fibre sourced from sustainably managed forests. The majority of dissolving wood pulp is consumed in the viscose industry where pulp is converted to yarn and ultimately textiles providing naturally soft, breathable fabrics. (ANA)
