ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia  — Ethiopian lawmakers have unanimously elected the country’s first female president, days after approving one of the world’s few “gender-balanced” Cabinets. Seasoned diplomat Sahle-Work Zewde succeeds Mulatu Teshome in the largely ceremonial post. She calls Ethiopia’s recent transfer of power to a reformist prime minister “exemplary” and says she will focus on bringing together all sides to achieve peace in a country with multiple ethnic-based conflicts in recent months. The prime minister’s chief of staff says that “in a patriarchal society such as ours, the appointment of a female head of state not only sets the standard for the future but also normalizes women as decision-makers in public life.” Ethiopian lawmakers last week approved a new Cabinet with a record 50 percent female members, including the country’s first woman defence minister. (AP)
