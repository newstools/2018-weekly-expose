JOHANNESBURG, October 29 – The resumption of bilateral ties between Sudan and Eritrea in the near future is a possibility, reports a newspaper in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir are due to meet following a visit by Sudan presidential assistant, Faisal Ibrahim, to the Eritrean capital Asmara in the next few days, the daily Al Meghar reported. The border between the two countries was closed in January this year after Sudan accused Eritrea of backing rebel groups and unidentified opposition groups. Thousands of troops were also deployed by Khartoum to the border area. In return, Asmara last May accused Sudan, Ethiopia and Qatar of supporting armed opposition groups attempting to overthrow Afwerki’s government. However, new Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has taken tentative steps towards peace both at home and with his neighbours. Last July saw a reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea following Ahmed’s initiative and regional efforts to ease tensions. But the possibility of re-establishing bilateral ties between Sudan and Eritrea is also a result of efforts by unnamed Sudanese political parties who have good relations with Afwerki. Another Sudanese presidential assistant Musa Ahmed, who is also the leader of the Beja Congress Party, is in Asmara and will return home on Tuesday to discuss normalising bilateral relations. Musa who was the leader of the rebel East Front signed a peace agreement with the Sudanese government, brokered by the Eritrean government in October 2006, and has remained close to the Eritrean president ever since. – African News Agency (ANA)
