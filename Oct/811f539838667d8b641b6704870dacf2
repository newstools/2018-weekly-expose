Sydney – Former sprinter Usain Bolt scored his first goals in professional football on Friday as he bagged a brace in the Central Coast Mariners 4-0 romp over Macarthur South West United, a second-tier local club, in a charity game.  Bolt was handed a first start in his trial, having been with the A-League team since August, and missed various chances in his role as striker before breaking his duck. He controlled a through ball, held off a defender and drilled a left-footed shot from 15 metres under the goalkeeper in the 56th minute. The goal brought the crowd to its feet cheering and his Mariners team-mates swarmed around the eight-time Olympic gold medallist to congratulate him. Bolt beamed as he stopped to give his famous lightning bolt salute before waving to the fans gathered at a suburban football field on a cold night in western Sydney for the match which was to raise money for fighting Parkinson’s disease. A defensive mix-up allowed Bolt to score again shortly before being substituted in the 75th minute. The A-League season begins next weekend but Bolt will not be part of the Mariners squad for their opener away to the Brisbane Roar. (dpa)
