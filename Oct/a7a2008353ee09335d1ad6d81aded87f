JOHANNESBURG, October 18 – The Johannesburg Magistrate’s court has postponed the bail application of nine men, including two police officers from Sophiatown police station, arrested in connection with the murder of 21-year-old Bradley Saul in Westbury. The case was postponed to Tuesday as lawyers representing four of the accused were not present. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said: “We are hoping that next week we will be able to set a date for the bail application. As the state I can say it’s a blessing for us because its gives us more time to prepare the affidavit in opposing the bail.” Mjonondwane said the lawyer who was supposed to represent two of the accused had withdrawn from the case: “He will have to come to court and withdraw properly as is the procedure”. Last week police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the State would oppose any efforts by the accused to apply for bail. Security was tight during proceedings and some people were denied access to the courtroom. Police said this was because of the high profile nature of the case and potential threats against those involved. The suspects will remain in custody.  (ANA)
