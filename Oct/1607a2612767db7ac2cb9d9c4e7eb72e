Bafana Bafana strike Lebo Mothiba scored for Strasbourg as they beat Monac0 2-1.  Former France great Thierry Henry suffered a miserable debut as he failed to steer the team out of trouble in his first match in charge. Monaco’s third choice goalkeeper Seydou Sy also experienced a disappointing night, easily conceding a header from Adrien Thomasson in the 17th minute. Monaco’s skipper Radamel Falcao walked off injured in the first half, and more miserably for the team, they were reduced to 10 men after Samuel Grandsir was sent off midway through the second half. As Monaco pressed forward for an equalizer, Strasbourg fully took advantage of that as striker Lebo Mothiba raced clear and chipped the ball over Sy with six minutes remaining. Monaco got a little consolation when Youri Tielemans converted a penalty into stoppage time. Winless since the opening round, Monaco find themselves second from the bottom and ahead of Guingamp just on goal difference. Guingamp recorded a goalless draw with Caen. Also on Saturday, Emiliano Sala scored a hat-trick to gift Nantes a 4-0 thrash of Toulouse. Reims and Angers bagged one point each following a 1-1 tie.
