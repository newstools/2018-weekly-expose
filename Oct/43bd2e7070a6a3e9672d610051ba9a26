JOHANNESBURG, October 11 – The University of Limpopo has suspended a Geography lecturer for alleged sexual harassment of female students at the institution. “The university views these allegations as serious for they compromise the image of the Institution and hinders the smooth process of quality teaching and learning,” the institution said in a statement on Thursday. “The Harassment Policy strongly condemns any form of sexual harassment, and any person who feels that she or he has been sexually harassed may lodge a complaint with the management of the university.” – African News Agency (ANA)
