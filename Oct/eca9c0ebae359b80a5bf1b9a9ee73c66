EKURHULENI, October 6 – A three-year-old toddler drowned after he apparently fell into a swimming pool at a home in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. Netcare 911 responded at about 2.15pm to reports of a drowning at a residence in Boksburg in Ekurhuleni, Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said.
