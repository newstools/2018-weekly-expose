PRETORIA, October 6 – New Zealand captain Kieran Read was full of praise for the Springboks after watching his side pull off a 32-30 win in their Rugby Championship clash at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Saturday night. Read could not hide his satisfaction speaking after the final whistle after his side scored three tries in the last 10 minutes to end the championship off on a resounding high. “You have to have believe in your side, deep down, if you are going to come back and win a game like this one,” said Read, who was pleased with his side’s composure despite trailing in all key facets throughout the contest. “We didn’t have the territory or possession, but we hung in there. We did just enough to help stem their momentum and always did just enough to keep ourselves in it. It took some good character from our lads and we had just enough time to win it at the end,” he said. The win helped New Zealand right the wrong of their shock home loss against the Springboks in Wellington earlier in the competition “The Boks were outstanding again tonight. Across the two games, we’re split evenly on the scoreboard. Fantastic couple of games and we’re just fortunate to come out on the right side tonight.” The All Blacks captain confirmed what many have alluded to in the build-up, with the clashes between the two sides reaching it’s usual level of intensity with the period of Springbok stagnation now seemingly a thing of the past. “100 percent, the rivalry is alive and well. The atmosphere was fantastic, it’s a great place to play and both teams have great respect for one another.” (ANA)
