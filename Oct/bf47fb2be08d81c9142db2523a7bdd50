JOHANNESBURG, October 12 – Packaged goods company Tiger Brands said on Friday it would re-open its Germiston Value Added Meat Products (VAMP) processing facility after it was issued a certificate of acceptability by the Ekurhuleni health department following rigorous assessments of the factory. Tiger Bands recalled processed meat products and suspended operations at several of its VAMP facilities earlier this year over a listeriosis outbreak. On Friday it said the certificate of acceptability issued to its Germiston plant endorsed the factory’s standards and operating procedures for the safe production of food products. “Production of ready-to-cook products, comprising bacon and frozen sausages, is expected to commence on 12 October 2018,” said Tiger Brands. “Salami production will also commence on this date.” It said the Clayville abattoir would supply the raw material requirements for the Germiston facility as well as fresh meat cuts. In addition, it would continue to contract slaughter on behalf of approved pig suppliers. Tiger Brands’ Enterprise meat canning operation, a separate unit on the Polokwane site, re-commenced production on September 12 after a certificate of acceptability for the operation was issued on August 31. “Structural refurbishments continue on the remaining units at the Polokwane facility and are expected to be completed by early November 2018, after which the department of health will conduct its assessments,” said Tiger Brands. (ANA)
