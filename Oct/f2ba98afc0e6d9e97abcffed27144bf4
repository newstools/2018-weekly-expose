Pieter Doorewaard, 27, and Phillip Schutte, 34 are accused of killing Matlhomola Mosweu, 16, in Coligny on October 20, 2017. The defence had called for the court to drop all charges against Schutte and preferred a case of capable homicide for Doorewaard while the State wanted the court to find them guilty on a charge of murder.

Mosweu’s death set off a mass violent protest in Coligny that left six houses and three trucks torched, several shops were looted and damaged. Doorewaard and Schutte are out on a R5000 bail each, their bail had been extend. (ANA)
