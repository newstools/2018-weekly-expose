JOHANNESBURG, October 19 – Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a fractured elbow, physiotherapist David Milner confirmed on Friday following the player’s recent car accident. “Lebo had MRI scans on Thursday and that revealed a fractured elbow. He will accordingly be treated and be put under a recovery plan,” said Milner. Manyama was involved in an accident while travelling from training on Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, Leonardo Castro and Dax Andrianarimanana are still out with injury. “Both Castro and Dax are progressively improving,” said Milner. Castro is recovering from an ankle injury, while Dax has a calf strain. Milner also said Khama Billiat will be assessed for a back injury. He hurt it while on international duty with Zimbabwe.
