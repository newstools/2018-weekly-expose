PARLIAMENT, October 24 – Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on Wednesday told media he would prefer to be addressed as “governor”, in a nod to his decade at the helm of the South African Reserve Bank. Mboweni bristled when a journalist opened questioning at a media briefing shortly before he delivered his maiden mid-term budget policy statement at Parliament by calling him minister. He quipped that he considered his former title as being a notch more prestigious and that the current SARB head, Lesetja Khanyaho, had agreed he could keep it as a honorific. “I am the eighth governor of the reserve bank and he is the tenth.”  (ANA)
