TSHWANE, October 1 – The Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria on Monday postponed the case against former police crime intelligence operative, Morris “Captain KGB” Tshabalala to December 3. Tshabalala’s lawyer Mpesi Makhanya said they were not ready to make representations to court. In August, Tshabalala was released on bail of R5000 by the same court. He was initially denied bail in January. Tshabalala faces charges of fraud, theft and corruption. He was arrested in December last year while checking in with his parole officer in Pretoria central and charged with theft and defrauding the South African Police Service. The former crime intelligence officer allegedly defrauded the slush fund of the SAPS crime intelligence unit of more than R500 000. According to the charge sheet, Tshabalala, in one instance, allegedly submitted fraudulent invoices amounting to R470,000 “needed to pay for blinds and curtains for a safe house” and then allegedly pocketed more than R200 000 from it.
