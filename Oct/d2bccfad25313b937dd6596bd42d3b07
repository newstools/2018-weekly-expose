JOHANNESBURG, October 13 – South Africa coach Stuart Baxter is confident his charges are ready to take on Seychelles in their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier at FNB Stadium on Saturday. The match starts at 3pm. The squad had its final training session at the match venue on Friday morning and Baxter said he was pleased with his side’s preparation. “The players have looked good and sharp,” said Baxter. “They had a heavy PSL programme so that is a good balance. I must say the majority (of players) have been very impressive at training.” Baxter said he was also impressed by the overall professionalism shown by the players. “I said to the players last night when we did the presentation, ‘what is that you see written on the middle’ and they said ‘Afcon qualifier’.  This is what we need to do (qualify for 2019 Afcon). The players want to play in major tournaments and this is the message we emphasised all along.” On Lebo Mothiba, the Bafana coach said the player will have some pressure on his shoulders as this was probably his biggest game in national colours, but he was confident the big striker would hold his own. “We want him to be natural; he is not a very typical South African player but he holds the ball well and has a nose for the goal. We shouldn’t put unnecessary pressure on him though.” After Saturday’s game, Bafana fly out to Seychelles on Sunday for the second leg which is on Tuesday at Stad Linite in Seychelles. (ANA)
