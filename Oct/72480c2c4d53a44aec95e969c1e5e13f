DURBAN, October 8 – The trial of Thabani Mzolo, who stands accused of shooting to death Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student Zolile Khumalo, has been postponed because his lawyer has not been paid. The matter, appearing before the Durban High Court on Monday, was adjourned to 15 October. Mzolo’s lawyer, Charl Claassen, asked to be withdrawn from the case on Monday, telling the court he had not been paid. The 24-year-old Mzolo is accused of killing 21-year-old Khumalo, a first-year quantity surveying student, inside her Lonsdale residence room on 1 May, and then, through a series of obscure social media posts, is believed to have confessed. The state has alleged that Khumalo ended the relationship she had with Mzolo in March or April this year. According to the indictment: “The termination of the relationship was not accepted by the accused. He decided to kill her.” Spurned by his former partner, Mzolo allegedly made his way to the off-campus residence, situated near the city centre, and gained entry after sending another student to check that Khumalo was in her room. Mzolo is alleged to have gunned down Khumalo in front of her roommate and the student who checked if she was in her room. The gun used in the killing was a nine-millimetre calibre pistol that had its serial number removed. Mzolo also, according to the indictment, had in his possession three live rounds of ammunition. At his first appearance, Mzolo garnered the wrath of students and community members for consistently grinning for photographers and appearing to make a trigger sign when leaving the courtroom, which was captured by journalists.
