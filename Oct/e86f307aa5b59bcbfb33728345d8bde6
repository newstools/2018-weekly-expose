JOHANNESBURG, October 26  – Duduzane, the son of former president Jacob Zuma, on Friday appeared briefly in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court where he faced charges of culpable homicide. The matter arises from a fatal collision in 2014 in which young Zuma’s Porsche crashed into a taxi resulting in the death of Phumzile Dube, a Zimbabwean national. On Friday the accused, who was accompanied by his father and a huge number of bodyguards who were dressed in black suits, was dropped off at the entrance of the court building. The matter was postponed to 24 January 2019 for a pre-trial. After a brief appearance, Duduzane Zuma emerged from the court and posed for pictures with supporters, who included members of the Black First Land First (BLF). “White people are making black people fight. We are going to find a solution for black people. White people are dividing us. All black people from the DA were outside the court loving Duduane like us,” shouted BLF leader Andile Mngxitama. “There is an attack on Zuma and they only arresting Duduzane to punish his father.” (ANA)
