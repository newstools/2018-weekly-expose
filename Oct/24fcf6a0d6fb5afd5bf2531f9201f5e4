JOHANNESBURG, October 5 – The police on Friday said “Coloured” townships where protests had been planned against “marginalisation and neglect” were mostly calm. “The situation is calm at  Ennerdale, no violence at this stage and no arrests have been made,” police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said. He said no property damage had been reported and more police had been deployed in affected areas where residents were burning tyres and blocking roads. The protests planned for Ennerdale, Eldorado Park, Lenasia and other “Coloured townships” erupted a day after calm was restored in Westbury. Residents of Westbury had been involved in running battles with the police for several days in protest against shootings and other crimes blamed on drug dealers in the area. The also accused officers from the Sophiatown Police station of being in cahoots with criminals in Westbury. They were burning tyres and blocking roads as part of a planned shutdown in parts of Gauteng. Residents of affected areas complained of rampant drug abuse, gun crime and the lack of police action to tackle the problems, which have been linked to joblessness among the youth. (ANA)
