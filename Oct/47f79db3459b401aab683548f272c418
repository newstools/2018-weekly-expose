JOHANNESBURG, October 4 – The opening of Rolls-Royce’s first lease engine storage facility at South African Airways Technical (SAAT) will equip it with the capability and capacity to offer technical support on a full range of engine types to meet the requirements of airline and jet customers in Africa, the department of trade and industry said on Thursday. The facility which will be based at Johannesburg’s Oliver Tambo International Airport illustrates an strategic partnership which will support the economic development in South Africa and the rest of the continent, acting deputy director-general for industrial development at the department of trade and industry Thandi Phele said. SAAT is a wholly owned subsidiary of national carrier South African Airways and is sole provider of aircraft maintenance to SAA, Mango and Comair/Kulula. “This partnership … will not only allow SAAT the ability to store engines this facility in compliance with engine manual requirements of Rolls-Royce; but equips it with the capability and capacity to offer technical support on a full range of Rolls-Royce engine types,” Phele said. “We appreciate the training programme that will be provided to SAAT staff to enable them to conduct work on engines in storage; and in future will be capable of performing a range of inspection and on-wing services to Rolls-Royce customers in Africa.” The opening of the facility would see SAAT play an expanding role in Rolls-Royce’s development of availability services across Africa as it increased its capability, said Kevin Evans, vice president customers for Africa at Rolls-Royce. “We have worked closely with South African Airways for a number of years, and we are delighted to be working with them on this initiative,” he said.
