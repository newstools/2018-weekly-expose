La Grange said: “In order for any legacy to remain current we have to provide the youth continuously and consistently with tools and skill to disseminate the legacy in an apt form. This is a fun way for youngsters to be innovative about Madiba’s legacy, to learn and to create an appetite for history. I look forward to experience their creativity.” The awards celebrate South African schools using Apple technology to transform teaching and learning. This year marks the centenary of Mandela birth and the awards introduced a special category to honour Madiba. This category provides students with the opportunity to honour the Mandela legacy by applying creativity to the theme of #RememberingMandela. Students were challenged to submit a two-minute video that must be innovative, creative and passionate. Michelle Lissoos, managing director at Think Ahead, said: “The Excellence in Education Awards has become a significant annual event in education across the country – celebrate excellence in bringing learning to life and aims to lead students to critical thinking, innovation and collaboration. Over the past 10 years, thousands of entries from a multitude of schools have been received as technology continues to play a bigger role than ever before.” – African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Lindiz van Zilla
