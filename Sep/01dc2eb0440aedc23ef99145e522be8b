JOHANNESBURG, September 27 – The Democratic Alliance held a picket outside the state capture commission of inquiry premises in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday calling on leaders of the governing African National Congress (ANC) to come forward and testify. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said state capture and corruption was a policy of the ANC. He demanded that all ANC leaders who have been implicated at the inquiry so far, come forward and tell South Africans their version of events. ”If you read ANC documents, you will see that it had intended to capture the state and levers of government. State capture is an act of corruption, we want the ANC to come and answer here. How can the president of the ANC [Cyril Ramaphosa] stand up and say he was not aware of state capture?” asked Maimane. ”You cannot say dealing with corruption is dealing with a faction in the ANC, and that only the Zuma faction is implicated in state capture by the Guptas. As unified as the ANC says it is, they must come and testify here in that united front.” Maimane was accompanied by MPs Natasha Mazzone and Phumzile Van Damme. The commission, headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, resumed on Thursday and will hear various applications. In the coming weeks, the inquiry will hear from Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene and the former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan. (ANA)
