JOHANNESBURG, September 26 – Eskom on Wednesday said about 75 percent of Vosloorus residents are without electricity after Nguni substation which supplies the area caught alight. Spokesperson Ntombifuthi Hlophe said the cables supplying various parts of Vosloorus were burnt inside the substation. “Various Eskom teams are still busy on site working on restoring supply to the affected residents,” said Hlophe. Hlophe urged members of the community to treat all cables as live to avoid injuries caused by contact with electricity. A case of arson is being investigated. (ANA)
