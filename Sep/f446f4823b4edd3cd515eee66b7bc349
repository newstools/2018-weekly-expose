CAPE TOWN, September 26 – The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) on Wednesday cautioned the public against fake Facebook and Instagram accounts purporting to belong to the corporation’s Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) Madoda Mxakwe. In a statement, the public broadcaster said: “It must be noted that Mr. Mxakwe is not on social media and does not have either a Facebook or Instagram account. Any account with his name and photograph is deemed fake and must be disregarded. The public is urged not to engage with these accounts, as they were created with the intent to mislead people. “The SABC views this matter in a serious light as this is just not a violation of Mr. Mxakwe’s rights and identity theft, but it also affects the SABC, as the organisation that Mr. Mxakwe represents.” (ANA)
