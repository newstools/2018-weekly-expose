CAPE TOWN, South Africa, September 27 – Cape Town City are seeking revenge when they travel to Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium for a MTN8 final rematch against SuperSport United on Saturday. Last season, the Citizens were on the wrong side of a penalty shootout loss against Matsatsantsa but return a stronger side, not only with further strength in depth but also battle hardened after another year’s worth of competitive football under their belts. It was a baptism of fire for then-new coach Benni McCarthy, who believes his side are in a good place ahead of the final. “I’ve grown and learnt and improved, and my team has also improved and matured, and I think we’re in a better situation than we were last season,” he said ahead of Saturday’s 7pm kick-off. McCarthy is sweating on the availability of new singing Tokelo Rantie, yet to lace his boots for his new side after his return from Turkey, with wing Surprise Ralani also facing a race against time to prove his fitness. In-form Taariq Fielies will take no part in the contest after seeing red against Kaizer Chiefs in a league clash but such has been City’s work in the transfer market these issues are far from catastrophic.
In the absence of these stars, the weight of goal-scoring expectations will fall onto Ayanda Patosi, who is finding form early in the season marked notably by his brace against Orlando Pirates. “We [are] all ready,” he said. “I’m ready and the atmosphere at the club has been good after the draw against Pirates, and everyone is ready for the final, to go and win it.” Patosi will be helped in attack by Matthew Rusike and Riyaad Norodien, but the biggest influence on Saturday’s results could be in goals with Peter Leeuwenburgh emerging as one of the finds of the season. The addition of the Dutch stopper has City matching their opponents across the park and combined with McCarthy’s desire for revenge, it could be a fruitful evening in Durban for City. (ANA)
