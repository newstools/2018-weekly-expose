CAPE TOWN, September 28 – The Transnet board has given group chief executive Siyabonga ten days to submit reasons as to why he should not be fired, board chairman Popo Molefe said on Thursday. “The board of Transnet has today served Mr. Siyabonga Gama with a letter informing him of the board’s intention to terminate his employment as group chief executive officer (GCEO) of Transnet SOC Ltd,” Molefe said. The reasons supplied to Gama were alleged serious violations of his financial, procurement and fiduciary duties. “As a result, the board has lost trust and confidence in Mr Gama’s ability to lead Transnet as GCEO,” Molefe said. He added that Gama had been given ten days “to make written representations as to why his appointment as GCEO should not be terminated”. Two law firms, Werksmans and MNS, have implicated Gama in alleged breaches of procurement rules on a R54 billion contract to buy new locomotives. Gama said that the investigations into the deal were incomplete, and preliminary findings based on an uncertain grasp of Transnet rules. He has accused Molefe of unfairly targeting him and written to Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, asking him to intervene for the sake of the sustainability of the rail freight company. Molefe on Thursday said the minister had been informed of the board’s decision. (ANA)
