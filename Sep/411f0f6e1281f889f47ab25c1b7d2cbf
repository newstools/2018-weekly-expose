JOHANNESBURG, September 26 – Capitec Bank said on Wednesday its headline earnings per share in the half year to August 31 increased by 20 percent to 2,128 cents compared with the same period in 2017. Capitec declared an interim dividend per share of 630 cents, up 20 percent over the previous half year. The bank said it planned to expand its product offering to include business banking, and that this may include the acquisition of Mercantile Bank Holdings, for which it submitted a formal bid on August 31. Capitec said it had completed the second tranche investment in Cream Finance Holdings which included existing shareholders exercising their option on September 10, taking its shareholding to 40.25 percent.. The third tranche is expected to be invested early in the next financial year. The bank said its capital adequacy ratio was 36 percent at August 31, and that should it re-allocate funds in the investment portfolio to lower-risk-weighted government instruments, the ratio could be increased by four percent. “The bank is well positioned for growth from a capital perspective,” it said.
