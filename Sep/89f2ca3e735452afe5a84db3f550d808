JOHANNESBURG, September 27 – Nedbank on Wednesday announced more details of its 2018 Ke Yona Team Search which will see youngsters training with PSL teams. The selected Team Search players will spend a month training with their respective teams, hoping to catch the eye of the various head coaches by putting into practice the lessons they have learned during their time in the Ke Yona Team Search camps. This provides them with a potentially life-changing opportunity, not just for themselves, but also for their families, as they seek to earn professional contracts and build a career in the Premier Soccer League. “The life-changing prospect of being part of a Premier Soccer League team is what has the 2018 Ke Yona team beaming with enthusiasm and hope, the same hope that 20-year old Bloemfontein Celtic Bongani Sam experienced this time last year,” said Nedbank’s Tobie Badenhorst. “We believe that if even a handful of the players walk away from the programme having learnt about how to manage money differently, we would have entrenched the culture of being financially savvy. “Nedbank is proud to be able to afford an opportunity of this magnitude to various communities and will certainly continue to play this important role of making others dreams a reality. “Congratulations to the Final 16 future stars who have been drafted into PSL clubs and good luck in showcasing your skills and football flair to those who will be watching,” concluded Badenhorst. The Nedbank Ke Yona Team Search talent identification initiative has proven to be a life-changing experience for a pool of professional players who have come through its ranks. Under its umbrella of unearthed talent are players who are currently plying their trade in both the PSL and National First Division (NFD).  (ANA)
