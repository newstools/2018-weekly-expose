JOHANNESBURG, September 26 – The sentencing of convicted rapist and model agency boss, Dawie de Villiers, was postponed on Wednesday as the judge presiding over the case had taken ill. In February 2017 De Villiers, the founder of Modelling South Africa (PTY), was found guilty of rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming, fraud, exposure of pornography to children and accessing child pornography. He has been out on bail since his conviction. State prosecutor Arveena Persad told the court that Judge Cassim Moosa was not well and asked that the matter be postponed to 23 November for sentencing at the High Court sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court. The matter was postponed to 23 November. (ANA)
