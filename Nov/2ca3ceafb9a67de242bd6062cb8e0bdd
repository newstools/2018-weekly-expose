CAPE TOWN, November 16 – Eskom on Friday announced the suspension of the head of its group capital division, Abram Masango. The utility said Masango was suspended with immediate effect pending an investigation into serious allegations of impropriety against him relating to the construction of the Kusile power station. “While we recognise his rights to be presumed innocent, the serious nature of the allegations made against him and the seniority of his position in Eskom, the Eskom management took a decision to place him on suspension pending the outcome of the investigation.” (ANA)
