PRETORIA,  November 22 – Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe cannot issue mining rights without the consent of the Xolobeni community in the Eastern Cape, the North Gauteng High Court ruled on Thursday. “It is declared that in terms of the Interim Protection of Informal Land Act 31 of 1996, the first respondent is obliged to obtain the full and informed consent of the applicants and the Umgungundlovu Community, as holder of rights in land, prior to granting any mining right,” read the court order. The Amadiba Crisis Committee (ACC) has been demanding that the courts grant them the power to refuse mineral resources commodities the right to extract titanium at the Umgungundlovu area in Xolobeni on the Wild Coast. The community of Xolobeni had concerns about displacement from their homes and grazing lands, as well as environmental degradation. Chairperson of ACC, Sibusiso Madi it was a victorious day for the community of Xolobeni. “It clearly shows that our struggle was not in vain, even the courts validate what we have been saying all along. We have the right to say no because we want to keep the land for the future generations,” he said. (ANA)
