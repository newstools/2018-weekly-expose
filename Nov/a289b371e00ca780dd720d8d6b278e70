Solly Makganoto Thusi Mbedu, the only African to be nominated at the 46th International Emmy Awards for her role on Is’thunzi, said that she hopes for more African representations in the international stages. This was Mbedu’s second nomination for the iEmmy’s as she was also nominated last year. Although she missed out on bagging an International Emmy Award on Monday night, the 27-year-old actress thanked the iEmmys for the nod and recognition. Taking to Twitter after the awards ceremony, Mbedu said she’s never been happier and thanked the iEmmy’s for the nod and recognition.  Kumnandi lana guys. I’ve never been happier. I hope more and more Africans work hard to rep us.
