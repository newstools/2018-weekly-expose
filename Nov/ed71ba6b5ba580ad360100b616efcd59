LOS ANGELES, November 5  – Actor Idris Elba, who James Bond fans are campaigning to be the next person to play 007, was named the sexiest man alive on Monday by People magazine. Elba, 46, is the 33rd hunk to receive the People magazine honour, which was announced Monday night on NBC’s “The Tonight Show” by host Jimmy Fallon. In reaction to the recognition, the “Thor” star said he’s “really happy with that one. My mum is going to be very, very proud.” Elba flashed a shy smile at Fallon’s request, flexed his bicep and thanked the magazine. Elba used his time in the spotlight to encourage fans to tend to their civic duty Tuesday, tweeting: “I’m honoured & thankful. What’s even more important is your vote in the midterm elections. Your vote can make a difference!” (Reuters)
