PARLIAMENT, November 6  – Embattled Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba on Tuesday waved his pinky finger to EFF member of Parliament (MP) Mbuyiseni Ndlozi in National Assembly after the latter suggested that ministers utilise camera-less cellphones and avoid recording themselves, referring to Gigaba’s leaked sex tape. Ndlozi showed the house a burner phone during a question and answer session by President Cyril Ramaphosa and suggested to Ramaphosa that he advise members of his Cabinet to not use camera phones and use burner phones as they cannot be hacked. “Honourable president, you might want to start ordering this phone for your Cabinet as it will save us from embarrassing activities. It does not have a camera and cannot be hacked. Can I give it to you so you can see which model of phones might be critical for honourable members?” Ndlozi asked Ramaphosa, who ignored his statement and smiled. Gigaba, whose sex tape is now featured on a porn site, was sat steadfastly and showed Ndlozi his pinky finger, suggesting that his now popular manhood was unmatched. The action by Gigaba drew Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) chief whip Floyd Shivambu’s ire who complained to Speaker Baleka Mbete. Gigaba took to Twitter on Sunday announcing that some people were blackmailing him and had hacked into his phone and leaked a sex tape meant for his wife. All manner of jokes and ridicule were thrown at Gigaba as the leaked tape went viral. He later apologised for the video, and vowed he will not resign from his cabinet post. (ANA)
