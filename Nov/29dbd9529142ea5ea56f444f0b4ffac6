ACCRA, Ghana, November 23 – After just two rounds of matches in the group stages of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations currently underway in Ghana, South Africa’s Thembi Kgatlana leads the goal-scoring charts with three strikes. The Banyana Banyana forward grabbed the headlines when she scored a stunner against defending champions Nigeria in their opening match of the tournament. Kgatlana followed that up with two goals against Equatorial Guinea in the second match of competition. South Africa also has six goal-scorers from the eight goals they have accrued – Kgatlana (3), Nompumelelo Nyandeni, Linda Motlhalo, Jermaine Seoposenwe, Amanda Mthandi and vice captain Refiloe Jane. Banyana defeated Nigeria 1-0 and whipped Equatorial Guinea 7-1 – the highest-scoring game in the tournament so far. South Africa’s next assignment is the final group stages fixture against Zambia at the Accra Sports Stadium on Saturday starting at 6pm SA time. Desiree Ellis’ charges top the group and are on six points – Nigeria and Zambia are tied on three points each, but the Super Falcons have a better goal difference. Equatorial Guinea has been eliminated from the tournament after two losses.  (ANA)
