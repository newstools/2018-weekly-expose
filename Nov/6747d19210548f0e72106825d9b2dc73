WASHINGTON, November 15 – The White House said on Wednesday that a senior aide of U.S. President Donald Trump will leave her current post after Trump’s wife Melania said earlier that the official did not deserve to work for Trump. In a statement issued by the White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders, White House deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel “will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration.” “The President is grateful for Ms. Ricardel’s continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities,” the statement read. However, the statement did not reveal what Ricardel’s new job would be. In an unusual move to weigh in on personnel matters in the realm of national security, the office of first lady Melania Trump on Tuesday called for the ouster of Ricardel, saying “it is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House.” Ricardel was tapped by U.S. National security adviser John Bolton in April to work as his deputy. She had previously worked as an undersecretary of commerce and had also held positions at the State and Defence departments. U.S. media reported that she had frequently clashed with U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis and spread rumours about the first lady. The White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has also reportedly sought to oust her. The removal came amid broader staff firing within the Trump administration after the midterm elections. Trump has forced out Jeff Sessions as attorney general. He also reportedly considered to sack Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and John Kelly as well.  (Xinhua)
