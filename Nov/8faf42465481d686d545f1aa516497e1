JOHANNESBURG, November 26 – Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has ordered that all boats be electronically registered and monitored after the weekend boating tragedy on Lake Victoria in which scores of people drowned. Rescue operations have recovered the bodies of 31 people so far from the 120 passengers that were on board with another 22 people rescued, the Daily Monitor reported. The Ugandan Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) is continuing their search for the remaining bodies following Saturday’s tragedy. The boat, which was unlicensed and unregistered, and probably also uninsured according to Museveni’s statement on Sunday, had a capacity for carrying only 50 people. The police said the main cause of the accident was overloading. However, the boat was also in a poor mechanical shape. According to media reports many of the boats that ply their trade on the lake and elsewhere in the region, lack standby engines, life jackets, reliable navigation and other safety features. Boating tragedies in Uganda and neighbouring countries which border Lake Victoria are not new. In September Tanzanian President John Magufuli ordered the arrest of the management of a ferry that capsized in Lake Victoria, after 131 people drowned. (ANA)
