London – Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling extended his contract on Friday, tying him to the Premier League champions until at least 2023. “I’m delighted to sign. My development here has been incredible,” the England international told City’s official website. “I felt from the minute I got here it was the right choice for me. It’s paid off and I’m really grateful.” The BBC reported that Sterling’s new contract will be worth around 300,000 pounds (390,000 dollars) per week. The 23-year-old has scored seven goals this season and 23 last term. His contract had been due to expire at the end of the 2019-2020 season. City’s director of football Txiki Begiristain said it was “a significant moment for the club”. “Raheem has improved dramatically in the past two seasons and is now one of the Premier League’s best attacking players. His statistics tell their own story. “He’s quick, strong and excellent in front of goal – everything a modern-day forward needs to excel.” (dpa)
