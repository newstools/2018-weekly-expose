JOHANNESBURG, November 11  – The hearings of the Zondo Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption, and Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of State will reconvene at 10am on Monday. The hearing will present the commission with the opportunity to hear testimony from the former minister of public enterprises Barbara Hogan, the commission said in a statement on Sunday. The commission would also hear testimony of the current Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordan on Thursday, it said. The legal team was in the process of identifying and/or consulting other witness who would be called to appear before the commission over the next few weeks. Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo postponed proceedings in October to give Hogan and Gordhan sufficient time to prepare their statements on events. (ANA)
