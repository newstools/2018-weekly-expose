SYDNEY, November 2 – The Central Coast Mariners have announced the departure of former Olympic sprinter turned footballer Usain Bolt, after he joined the Aussie club back in August for an indefinite training trial. Despite being unable to come to a “commercial” agreement ahead of the A-league season, the 32-year-old said on Friday that he was grateful to the club for the opportunity. “I would like to thank the Central Coast Mariners owners, management, staff, players and fans for making me feel so welcome during my time there,” he said. “I wish the club success for the season ahead.” Featuring in two pre-season matches for the Mariners, the eight-time gold medallist was able to net two goals in his side’s a 4-0 win against Macarthur South West United. “Despite the fact that we could not come to an agreement that would continue Usain Bolt’s football journey with the Central Coast Mariners, we’ve been thrilled to have the Olympic champion sprinter and world record holder as part of our Club for these past eight weeks,” Central Coast Mariners owner Mike Charlesworth said. “For the Mariners, it’s been a pleasure to work with Usain as he pursued his desire to become a professional football player. He integrated very well into the team and made great strides as a footballer,” Charlesworth added. “Whilst we understand that Usain will not be part of the Club going forward, the Central Coast Mariners wish him all the best in his future endeavours and we hope that opportunities arise to collaborate in other capacities in the future,” he concluded.  (Xinhua)
