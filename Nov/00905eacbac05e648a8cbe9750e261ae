Solly Makganoto Moses Mabhida stadium general manager, Vusi Mazibuko has on Tuesday given music fans a green light and assured them that the stadium is ready to host Cassper Nyovest. The iconic stadium which was voted the most popular stadium in South Africa in an online poll, will be the place to be on 1 December. Cassper took to Twitter to share his excitement: “No form of negativity or bad weather will stop us from #FillUpMosesMabhida…. it’s our chance and we know it every year y’all will try to break us apart but TEAM NYOVEST is stronger than what you think it is. Get your tickets and be part of history”. “It’s not about filling up the stadium but more so to change the mindset of an African child. The reason why you can’t treat ur own with the same respect as international acts is cause u believe you’re inferior. Well, we been changing that mentality 1 fill up a time”, twitteed Cassper Nyovest last year during his #FillUpFNBStadium. Nyovest has also called on Durbanites to apply for the second instalment of his Fill Up Internship Programme. The “Mama I Made It’ hitmaker started the internship programme last year, as a means to help young people equip themselves with tangible skills across various event disciplines. Those who are keen to participate can interview for positions on 17 November at Moses Mabhida Stadium between 10am and 3pm. Current intern positions available include operations, talent operations, logistics, accreditation, hospitality & catering, merchandise, marketing, PR and sponsorship.  There are only 50 spots up for grabs. Applicants also need to be 18 years and older and need to bring along a certified copy of the identity document.
