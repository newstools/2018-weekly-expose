ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, November 15 – Running legend Haile Gebrselassie on Wednesday resigned as president of the Ethiopian Athletics Federation (EAF) after two years in charge. In a tweet, Gebrselassie said: “It is with regret that I hereby announce my resignation as president of the EAF.” In a follow-up statement, he added: “I became president of the EAF because I wanted to give something back to my sport; athletics is my passion. “However, some people were making the work impossible, so it is better to leave. I am happy we could force such a big step in our fight against doping and also on other issues, there are changes needed and I wish my successor wisdom and strength.” Gebrselassie will be replaced by the EAF’s vice-president, two-time Olympic 10 000m gold medallist Derartu Tulu. Gebrselassie is considered the greatest distance runner ever after major competition wins at distances from 1 500 metres to the marathon. He won two Olympic gold medals and set 27 world records.  (ANA)
