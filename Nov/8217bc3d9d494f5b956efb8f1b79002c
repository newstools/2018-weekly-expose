CAPE TOWN, November 12 – Sentencing proceedings in the trial of three men who kidnapped, raped and murdered student Hannah Cornelius and severely injured her friend, Cheslin Marsh in Stellenbosch last year are expected to get underway in the high court in Cape Town on Monday afternoon. Vernon Witbooi, Geraldo Parsons and Eben van Niekerk were convicted last week of robbery, kidnapping, rape and murder. A fourth man, Nashville Julius was found guilty of robbery and kidnapping. Marsh and Cornelius were attacked by the four men at about 3am on May 27, 2017 while they were chatting in a car after a night out with friends. They were threatened with a knife and a screwdriver before they were robbed and taken to an open veld where Marsh was bludgeoned with bricks and left for dead. He survived the attack. The suspects then drove off with Cornelius and took her to a secluded spot where they took turns raping her. They then drove her to a wine farm where they stabbed her to death. Last week, the families of the victims pleaded with the court to impose the maximum sentence on the accused. – African News Agency (ANA)
