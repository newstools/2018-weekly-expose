ASUNCION, November 13 – Paraguay will meet South Africa in the annual Nelson Mandela Challenge charity match next month, the South American nation’s football association said on Monday. The November 20 clash at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban will raise funds for children in need. It will mark the first time that Juan Carlos Osorio takes charge of Paraguay in an official match.

His 24-man squad includes newcomers Alejandro Romero, Christian Paredes, Hector Villalba, all of whom play in the United States. Following is the squad: Goalkeepers: Antony Silva (Cerro Porteno), Alfredo Aguilar (Olimpia), Santiago Rojas (Nacional). Defenders: Fabian Balbuena (West Ham), Junior Alonso (Celta de Vigo), Bruno Valdez (America), Lorenzo Melgarejo (Spartak), Juan Patino (Olimpia), Santiago Arzamendia (Cerro Porteno), Omar Alderete (Huracan), Juan Escobar (Cerro Porteno).
