JOHANNESBURG, November 2 – The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Friday, dismissed Lerato Sengadi’s interdict to stop the funeral of her late partner hip hop artist Hip-Hop Pantsula (HHP) Jabulani Tsambo, after she was declared his customary wife. Sengadi approached the court to apply for an urgent interdict to stop the funeral in Mahikeng. The court declared that Sengadi was Tsambo’s customary wife but denied the interdict to stop the funeral. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng said Tsambo was a well-known musician and a state funeral has been organised. “Jabba was a national hero, and he deserves a decent funeral,” said Mokgoathleng. He said Sengadi met the requirements for their customary marriage, and because there was no handover does not mean there was not a marriage. Customary law is not rigid, the judge said. The court gallery was full with friends and family in court to support Sengadi. Mokgoatlheng asked Lerato to attend the funeral “in the spirit of Ubuntu”. She broke down and cried after the judgment was made. Tsambo’s funeral service will go ahead as planned on Saturday in Mahikeng.
