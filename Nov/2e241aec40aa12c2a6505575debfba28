JOHANNESBURG, November 20 – Baroka FC are on the brink of creating history this weekend during the Telkom Knockout semifinals in Polokwane when they play Bidvest Wits at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday (start at 3pm). The Peter Mokaba Stadium precinct – both old and new venue – has been their lucky charm in the 2018/19 Telkom Knockout so far. It is at these two venues – both a stone throw away from each other – where they secured a path to the semifinals. In the round of 16, Baroka defeated Lamontville Golden Arrows 2-0. They faced Mamelodi Sundowns in the quarterfinal in a fixture many predicted that the latter would win. But Baroka soldiered on – surprising Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0. Not only did they win that match, they dominated possession. Now Baroka have set their eyes on the final with the club chairman already indicating that after a number of years in top flight football, silverware is now due. They have never gone beyond the semifinals in any cup competition before, since they made grand entrance into top flight football a few seasons ago. Now, as they face a Bidvest Wits side that is also armed with experience and a penchant for cup glory, Baroka’s guts and determination will be tested. Wits have been on-form in the Premiership, currently second from the top. Baroka, on the other hand, have been struggling with consistency as they occupy 12th in the log standings. (ANA)
