YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast, November 22 – Ivory Coast and Chelsea legend Didier Drogba announced on Thursday that he has officially retired from football. Now aged 40, the dynamic forward made 381 appearances for Chelsea, winning four Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the 2012 Champions League when he took the final penalty in a dramatic shootout to clinch the trophy against Bayern Munich. He also retires as Ivory Coast’s record goal-scorer with 65 goals. “I want to thank all the players, managers, teams and fans that I have met and made this journey one of a kind,” Drogba said on Twitter on Thursday. “If anyone tells you your dreams are too big, just say thank you and work harder and smarter to turn them into a reality. “When I think of the last 20 years of my professional career, I can’t be more proud of what I’ve achieved as a player, but most importantly how this journey has shaped me as a man.” (ANA)
