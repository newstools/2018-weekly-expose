Birtukan Mideksa has been sworn in as the head of Ethiopia’s electoral board, the broadcaster reported. She returned to Ethiopia earlier this month after seven years in exile in the US. She was among dozens of opposition leaders who were jailed after the contested elections of 2005 that led to the deaths of hundreds of people. Late October, a week after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed filled half his new cabinet with women in a radical overhaul, the country’s parliament took another step towards gender parity by appointing the country’s first female president. Sahle-Work Zewde, 68, a seasoned diplomat who previously held positions in the United Nations and worked in peacekeeping operations in Africa, accepted the position after the unprecedented appointments of women to lead the defence ministry and the secret intelligence agency.  (ANA)
