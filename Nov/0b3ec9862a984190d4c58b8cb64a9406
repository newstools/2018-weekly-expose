His office said that all efforts were being made to expedite the processing of these Bills without compromising Ramaphosa’s obligation, adding that he was assessing the legislation with a view to ensure that their “development – through consultation and drafting – is not vulnerable to legal challenge and that it is constitutionally compliant”. “The President is applying his mind with urgency and thoroughness to enable the soonest feasible commencement of new dispensations in the respective sectors or areas of interest.” Ramaphosa will apprise Parliament and the public as soon as he has made a decision on the Bills. – African News Agency (ANA)
