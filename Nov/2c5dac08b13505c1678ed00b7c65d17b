DURBAN, November 23 – Orlando Pirates will be full of confidence when they meet Kaizer Chiefs in a Telkom Knockout semifinal match at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday, knowing they have not lost to the AmaKhosi in their last 10 meetings. This is the longest run of winless games for Chiefs in the near 50-year history of the Soweto Derby. The last Chiefs victory came in a 2-0 league success in December 2014, when Siphiwe Tshabalala and Siphelele Mthembu netted for the Glamour Boys. Chiefs and Pirates will be meeting in a cup competing for the first time since the Buccaneers ousted their Soweto rivals from the Nedbank Cup last-32 in 2016, when Tendai Ndoro netted a brace of goals in a 2-0 win. The teams last met in the Telkom Knockout that same season when they played to a 0-0 draw in the semifinals, with Chiefs edging the penalty shoot-out 6-5. They would go on to lose the final 3-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns. Chiefs have played 73 matches in the Telkom Knockout competition in the PSL era, winning 41 to go with 18 draws and 14 defeats. They have scored 109 goals in that time and conceded 62. Chiefs’ number of matches in the Telkom Knockout in the PSL era, 73, is the most by any side over that period. It is one more than Pirates. The club’s 41 victories in the Telkom Knockout is also the most of any team in the PSL era, with Pirates on 38, making them the most successful side in that period in terms of fixtures won. Pirates have played a total of 72 matches in the Telkom Knockout in the PSL era, winning 38 of those to go with 17 draws and 17 defeats. But for all of their domestic success down the years, Pirates have only ever won the Telkom Knockout title once, in 2011 – this despite reaching the final eight times. (ANA)
