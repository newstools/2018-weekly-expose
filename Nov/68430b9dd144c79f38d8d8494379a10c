JOHANNESBURG, November 29 â€“ Ugandan security forces are hunting down the captain (coxswain) of the MV Templar that capsized on Saturday night on Lake Victoria killing more than 30 revellers. Twenty-six people were rescued, 32 bodies recovered, from more than 100 passengers that were on board the boat when it overturned during the weekend tragedy. Officers from police and internal security in Mpata sub-county, Mukono District, believe the coxswain hails from Muzindeere Village in the same sub-county but his fate or whereabouts had not been established by Wednesday night, the Daily Monitor reported Thursday. He was not among the survivors or one of the dead whose bodies were recovered and his exact identity is still to be verified. But police confirm that he is a person of interest in their investigations and have asked anybody with details to come forward. The untrained coxswain, who was hired on a part time basis, was reported to have replaced the usual captain of the boat who had refused to operate the vessel saying it was not fit to sail. The boat had been grounded for months due to mechanical faults and was unlicensed and unregistered. Police are trying to get to the bottom of how the vessel, which they say was heavily overloaded, only having a capacity to carry 50 people was managed. Media reports said many of the boats that ply their trade on the lake, and elsewhere in the region, lack standby engines, life jackets, reliable navigation and other safety features. Boating tragedies in Uganda and neighbouring countries which border Lake Victoria are not new. In September Tanzanian President John Magufuli ordered the arrest of the management of a ferry that capsized in Lake Victoria, after 131 people drowned. (ANA)
