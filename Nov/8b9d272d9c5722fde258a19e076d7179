ARLIAMENT, November 22 – Economic Freedom Fighters member of Parliament (MP) Mbuyiseni Ndlozi on Wednesday reiterated the party’s protest to the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture sitting in Hill on Empire, a building owned by Tiso Blackstar media group, in Parliament. In a declaration on the budgetary review report of the chief justice, Ndlozi told the National Assembly: “The Zondo commission must get out of the headquarters of Tiso Blackstar with immediate effect.” The declaration comes a day after EFF leader Julius Malema launched an attack on journalists and said the commission was at risk of becoming a “Mickey Mouse” inquiry and a waste of taxpayer’s money because of the building in which it was based. He went as far as calling the media group “the new capturers”, including it in a wider attack on the Zondo commission and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan who has been testifying before the inquiry this week.
