JOHANNESBURG, November 15 – The revenue for South African municipalities is expected triose to R431.5 billion in 2019/20 and R462.5 billion in 2020/21 from a budgeted R404.6 billion for 2018/19, the National Treasury said on Thursday. In a statement on the medium term revenue and expenditure framework for municipalities, the Treasury said total municipal expenditure in 2018/19 was estimated at R441.6 billion, up 5.7 percent from 2017/18, and would increase to R467.9 billion in 2019/20 and R495 billion in 2020/21.

The Treasury said municipal operating expenditure on water, electricity, waste water management and waste management was budgeted to increase from R174.7 billion in 2017/18 to R184.3 billion in 2018/19, equating to half of the total operating expenditure of municipalities.
