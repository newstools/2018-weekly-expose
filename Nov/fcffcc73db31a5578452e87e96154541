JOHANNESBURG, November 13  – Bafana Bafana kicked off their preparations for their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier match against Nigeria at Steyn City School in Johannesburg on Monday with no new injury worries.
Training in the heatwave which is ongoing in Gauteng, team doctor, Thulani Ngwenya said the camp had started well without any new hiccups.
Goalkeeper Ronwen Williams will be monitored for the next two days, but Ngwenya said the keeper’s injury was a minor setback.
Thulani Serero, who arrived in camp on Monday carrying a slight injury, trained on his own but will join the rest of the team on Tuesday, as will defender Thamsanqa Mkhize who was also rested having played the entire 90 minutes on Sunday.
“Otherwise, there are no new injuries and I must say Monday began very well,” said Dr Ngwenya.
Bafana take on Nigeria on Saturday in their Afcon qualifier at FNB Stadium in which a win will seal a berth in the finals scheduled for Cameroon next year.
The match kicks off at 3pm and tickets are on sale at Computicket, Shoprite and Shoprite Checkers stores countrywide. They are going for R60. (ANA)
