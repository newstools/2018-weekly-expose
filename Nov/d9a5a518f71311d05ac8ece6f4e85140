JOHANNESBURG, November 17 – It’s a simple equation when Bafana Bafana meet Nigeria in an Afcon qualifier at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday (start at 3pm). The winner of the clash will automatically qualify for Cameroon while the losers will have to wait a little longer until the final qualifiers in March next year. Bafana coach Stuart Baxter told the media on Friday his charges were ready for this crucial clash. “It is going to be a tough game as Nigeria are a good team.  They will create problems on many levels but if we stretch ourselves and play to the best of our ability, we will give them problems,” he said. The recalled the Uyo encounter in which South Africa defied odds to come away with a convincing 2-0 win. “We were tactically disciplined in Uyo and we hope to do the same, come Saturday. We don’t want them to dictate the pace, we are at home. “We want to create big spaces because we are good with big spaces,” said Baxter adding that it is imperative that the hosts take every chance they create. Baxter also touched on the huge incentives Nigeria players have been promised to win this match saying money to him has never been an issue as a player and today. “When I started playing football and even now, money has never been my god. It is nice to have but I don’t feel better rewarded if someone gives me an extra million; the biggest reward is to see the public smile and players proud of themselves.” Baxter played down issues of nerves saying the team had a good session on Thursday on how to deal with pressure. “I can only control what I can control and what I can’t control, I won’t worry about,” he concluded. – African News Agency (ANA)
