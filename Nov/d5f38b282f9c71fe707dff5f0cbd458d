CAPE TOWN, November 26 – Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has laid charges against Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema with the police and the Equality Court following last week’s verbal attacks on him and his family. “The determined defence of corruption and the corrupt, using personal attacks, racism and alleged hate speech is not acceptable and must be challenged,” Gordhan said on Monday. “I have not responded until now to the absolute nonsensical and unsubstantiated attacks, but extending these attacks to my family and threatening harmony amongst the people of South Africa was a step too far. Enough is enough.” The ministry said Gordhan has asked the court to determine whether Malema’s utterances constitute hate speech. He has asked the police to determine whether it amounted to incitement to violence and also laid a charge of criminal defamation. (ANA)
