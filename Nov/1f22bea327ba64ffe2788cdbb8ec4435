JOHANNESBURG, November 21 – South Africa’s e-Commerce sector is likely to get a major boost on Black Friday and Cyber Monday as more consumers take advantage of the convenience of online shopping to avoid long queues, banking group FNB said on Wednesday. South Africa, like several other countries, has adopted “Black Friday”, the informal name for the day after Thanksgiving in the US, the fourth Thursday of November, which is regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. “Cyber Monday” refers to the Monday after Thanksgiving, which has generally become an extended day of frenzied bargain hunting. Last year, FNB processed an average of over 800,000 card transactions per hour which peaked at 1.5 million card transactions because of the Black Friday spree. “The transaction volumes give a firm indication that Black Friday has become one of the important days for South African consumers,” FNB Retail CEO Raj Makanjee said. “Many see this as an opportunity to stretch their budgets amid unrelenting pressure on household income. Consumers who have set aside a budget will be in a better financial position and we encourage those who need to use credit to do so responsibly.” “It’s vital for consumers to consider that there’s still a long festive season ahead, therefore, it’s important to reserve some funds for unforeseen emergencies,” Makanjee added. FNB said it had seen an overall increase of 120 percent in card payment volumes during last year’s Black Friday, compared to a typical Friday. The spike in spending was driven by a 250 percent increase in purchases from local online retailers versus the 80 percent spend increase at physical retailers. (ANA)
