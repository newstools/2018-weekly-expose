RUSTENBURG, November 12 – Security has been beefed up at the Ditsobotla municipality in Lichtenburg in North West province after unemployed people forced municipal workers out of their offices. “We have appointed a new security company,” spokesperson Pius Batsile said on Monday, adding all municipal workers were expected to return to work. Last week a group of people from Boikhutso shut down the municipality, forcing employees to vacate offices and disrupting services. In May 2017 a group of residents from Boikhutso, also known as Phola, held mayor Daniel Buthelezi hostage and torched a portion of the municipal building. The mayor was not hurt during the incident and 32 people were arrested on charges ranging from kidnapping and arson to attempted murder. – African News Agency (ANA)
