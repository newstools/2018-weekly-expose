JOHANNESBURG, November 29 – Zambian President Edgar Lungu has commuted more death penalties to life imprisonment than any other serving president, Justice Minister Given Lubinda has said. Lubinda said this decision not to sign death penalties has earned Lusaka a reputation internationally as an abolitionist country with regards to the death penalty, the Lusaka Times reported. The justice minister made his comments during transit in Addis Ababa,  Ethiopia, on his way to Rome to attend a conference on the 10th Anniversary of the campaign against the death penalty. The conference is hosted by an organisation called St. Egidio. Zambia has also voted in the affirmative at the United Nations on maintenance of a moratorium of the death penalty. In 2016 Lungu permitted the Zambian embassy in New York to start voting in favour of abolishing the death penalty after abstaining from the vote for a number of years. Despite the death penalty still being upheld in the Zambian constitution, no president has signed it since 1998. Unlike other laws that can easily be amended the death penalty is part of the bill of rights that can only be amended through a referendum. (ANA)
