JOHANNESBURG, November 2  – The South African Revenue Service (Sars) on Friday said it has “noted” the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphisa that he has fired suspended tax commissioner, Tom Moyane. In a terse statement, Sars said any enquiries in this regard must be directed to the Office of the Presidency. Moyane, who was sacked on Thursday, is mounting a legal challenge to his dismissal. Judge Robert Nugent, who is heading an inquiry into Moyane, had recommended the suspended tax chief should be removed from office for the “reckless mismanagement of SARS” under his tenure. Moyane has repeatedly defended his record and denied any wrongdoing.
