HARARE, November 8 – As many as 47 people have died in a horror collision between two long-distance buses that were travelling between the capital and the eastern border town of Mutare. The buses identified as “Smart Express” and “Bolt Cutter” collided head-on Wednesday near Rusape, a town some 138km east of the capital, Harare. National police spokesman Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said 30 bodies had already been identified. The local government morgue has run out of space and has appealed for assistance from private mortuaries. It was not clear how many others survived or were injured. Police are investigating the cause of the tragic collision that occurred along a stretch of road that had been resurfaced.  (ANA)
