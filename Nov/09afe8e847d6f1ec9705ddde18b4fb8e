WASHINGTON, November 7  – Women and US minority groups including gays and Muslims achieved historic victories during the midterm elections at the federal and statewide levels. On Tuesday, Democrat Rashida Tlaib was elected to an open House seat in the US state of Michigan and Ilhan Omar was elected in Minnesota from the state’s venerable Democratic-Farmer-Labour Party, making them the first two Muslim women to become members of Congress. In addition, the state of Colorado elected to office the country’s first openly-gay governor, Jared Polis​​​. New York City’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an avowed socialist, will become the youngest ever woman to sit in the US Congress at age 29. US Congress ended up divided at the end of Tuesday’s midterm elections, with the Democratic Party projected to take the House and the Republicans expected to maintain control of the Senate. (Sputnik)
