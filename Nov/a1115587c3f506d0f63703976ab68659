JOHANNESBURG, November 27 – After successfully disposing of Kaizer Chiefs over the weekend to reach the final of the Telkom Knockout, Orlando Pirates now prepare for a  Caf Champions League clash against Seychelles’ Light Stars at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Wednesday (start at 7.30pm). The Mighty Buccaneers kick off their Champions League campaign to a Stars side that are a closed book. In 2016, Light Stars faced Bidvest Wits in the Caf Confed Cup. The Students marched towards a 9-0 aggregate victory which included a 6-0 home win and a 3-0 win away from home. Vincent Pule played and scored in the 6-0 rout against Stars. The Bucs winger recalls that match fondly but gave a word of caution to his new teammates ahead of this upcoming encounter. “I remember the match against Light Stars,” said Pule. “Some might think because we previously won that game 6-0 our game on Wednesday will be a walkover, but I’ve already told my teammates that this is one team that we cannot afford to underestimate. “Teams like this have nothing to lose…the players give it their all and they have no pressure. The pressure will be all on us. “We need to show we are a big team and we can only do so by dominating the match from the first whistle. We cannot afford to underestimate them. “Furthermore, two years is a long time in football. The team that Wits played two years ago will not necessarily be the team that Pirates face on Wednesday. “The same can be said for us at this stage; we have gone from failing to qualify for the top eight to finishing second and competing in the Champions League a year later,” the 26-year old concluded.
